It lists multiple farm vendors who sell their products directly to the consumers at a common, recurrent physical location. Information such as name of the market, its location, product offerings, operating times and accepted forms of payment has been provided.

## Packages required
dplyr, usmap, ggplot2, lubridate, openintro, treemap; all downloadable from CRAN

## Year-wise evolution

There has been a substantial increase in the farmer markets after 2012, peaking at the year of 2014 and then at the year of 2016, but has been declining since then.

##Month-wise seasonality effect

The months of May and June show the highest number of farmer markets throughout the year. We can infer that the Summer season has a positive effect on the count of farmer markets, possibly due to the weatherâ€™s effect on the harvesting yield of the crops.
